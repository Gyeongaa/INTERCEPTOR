INTERCEPTOR project

## Project description
Artificial Intelligence based analysis of histopathology images of biopsies to predict response to neoadjuvant therapy 

## Goals:
The ultimate aim is to produce a broadly applicable, easily accessible, and trustworthy standard for NAT response assessment in routine biopsy specimens that will easily outperform current classification systems.

This project contains 4 work packages and this respository will be used for the purpose of code sharing.
